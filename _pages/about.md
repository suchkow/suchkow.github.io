{% include about-picture-img.html %}

I have finished and done some courses at Coursera:
- "Internet Giants: The Law and Economics of Media Platforms" — The University of Chicago
- "Microeconomics principles" — The University of Illinois
- "Combinatorics and Probability" — University of California San Diego & HSE University "Основы программирования на Python" - HSE University
- "Swift 5 iOS Application Developer" — LearnQuest

Besides studies, I do ice hockey. I have finished "Spartak Moscow" hockey school in 10 years, and now I am a member of HSE University Ice Hockey Team.
At my leisure time, I do some work at freelance-cites, doing the job of a translator (Russian - English) or as a programmer (using C++ and Python for back-end or big data analysis).

Furthermore, I have launched my own business in an e-commerce sphere; that is now being already closed. I have been cultivating a website for NFT-marketplace platform in collaboration with the Innovation Center of Skolkovo. I have created a magazine published on the [VK website](https://vk.com/thewhatyellow). I was an ideological inspirer, gathered and organized a group of friends who created content (articles, music selections, sports analytics).
