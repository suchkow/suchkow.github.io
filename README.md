# About Me

[Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.datarevenue.com/) and Data Scientist in 
the Metabolomics and Bio-Tech space, spending significant time on database 
integrations and API design, owning the end-to-end processes from data 
extraction to deploying models and releases.

Formerly a writer and regular contributor to 
[Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/@cereniyim), following 4 years as an 
SAP consultant with project management and team leadership roles in the 
Transportation Management space.

Open to a product-focused role that can help me gain more experience in the 
complete software development lifecycle and engineering best practices, 
meanwhile owning complete product features that have a primary focus in 
Machine Learning.

Regardless of team and company size, working with and learning from experienced 
senior engineers and leaders along a clear career path would be a key differentiator.
