# About Me

I have finished and done some of the courses at Coursera:
- "Internet Giants: The Law and Economics of Media Platforms" - The University of Chicago
- "Microeconomics principles" - The University of Illinois
- "Combinatorics and Probability" - University of California San Diego & HSE University "Основы программирования на Python" - HSE University
- "Swift 5 iOS Application Developer" - LearnQuest

Besides studies I do ice hockey. I have finished "Spartak Moscow" hockey school in 10 years and now I am a member of HSE University Ice Hockey Team.
At my leisure time I do some work at freelance-cites, doing job of a translator (Russian - English) or as a programmer (using C++ and Python for back-end or big data analysis).
Furthermore I launched my own business in e-commerce sphere, that is now had already closed. I have been cultivating a website for NFT-marketplace platform in collaboration with Innovation Center of Skolkovo.
