Hello! Recently, I have decided to enhance my old online resume. So, I have found an example and set up my own blogging website.

Every day, I am work in progress and studying Data Science & Business Analytics.
<a href="/about" class="internal-link quarter-line-space">More about me&nbsp;→</a>

Main chapter of my site, where I post long-reads about anything.
<a href="/blog" class="internal-link quarter-line-space">Check out my articles&nbsp;→</a>

I do not have much time for frequent update of small notes. Nevertheless, there is something...
<a href="/notes" class="internal-link quarter-line-space">Discover my notes&nbsp;→</a>

If you are somehow an HR (or any other corporate worker) and want to fully appreciate me (or for some curious eyes).
<a href="/portfolio" class="internal-link quarter-line-space">Go and see my portfolio&nbsp;→</a>

Please get in touch with the [contact page](/_pages/contact).
